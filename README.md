Brad the Brat was created in 2006 as an experimental management game for Nintendo DS, but an early prototype was created for Nintendo Gameboy Advance. Unforuntately the source code has been lost, but a ROM and some documentation survived.

The goal of the game is to satisfy Brad's needs for a whole day by exploiting others in the daycare center. Press START to view Brad's current demands and interact with children and supervisors to satisfy Brad's need for attention, activity and recognition.
